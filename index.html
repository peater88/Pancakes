    <h1>ðŸ¥ž The Best Pancake Recipe</h1>
    <p>These pancakes are fluffy, quick, and super easy to make! Here's my favorite recipe â€“ it makes about 25 pancakes:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1000 ml milk</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>500 g plain flour (all-purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of rum (optional â€“ but I love it!)</li>
      <li>A little butter for the pan (ideally, use a pan with a white surface made for pancakes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix together the milk, eggs, and rum. Gradually add the flour while whisking to create a smooth batter. I use a hand whisk and add the flour one spoonful at a time to avoid lumps.</p>
    <p>Now heat up your pan â€“ this is key! A well-heated pan helps ensure your first pancake is perfect. Use a soup ladle to portion the batter â€“ I use about half a ladle per pancake to keep them nice and thin.</p>
    <p>Add a bit of butter to the pan, pour in the batter, and tilt the pan to spread it evenly. You'll see the bottom starts to brown â€“ thatâ€™s your sign to flip it. You can even try flipping it mid-air for fun ðŸ˜Š (they donâ€™t stick).</p>
    <p>The second side cooks faster â€“ so watch out not to burn it! Then continue: butter, batter, and repeat. Enjoy your pancakes! ðŸ˜‹</p>
